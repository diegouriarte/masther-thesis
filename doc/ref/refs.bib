These techniques are particularly well-suited to investigate events occurring at an aggregate level (i.e., countries, cities, regions, etc.) and affecting a relatively small number of units. Benefits and features of the Synth package are illustrated using data from Abadie and Gardeazabal (2003), which examined the economic impact of the terrorist conflict in the Basque Country.},

  abstract = {This paper studies how gas stations adjust their gasoline and diesel prices in response to their neighboring competitors. The empirical analysis relies on data collected from January to August 2011 on the daily prices of 20 gas stations located in Cuneo, Italy. These data show significant price uniformity, especially within the same geographical area of the town. Approximately one-third of gas stations responded within a day to targeted competitors' price changes, indicating some evidence of price matching behavior in the industry. Additionally, there is some, but discontinuous, geographical price propagation, testifying to the presence of a weak domino effect. Finally, spatial econometric analysis suggests that there is spatial dependence between gas stations up to about 1.1 km.},

We exploit the dispersion of emissions-cheating diesel cars—which secretly polluted up to 150 times as much as gasoline cars—across the United States from 2008-2015 as a unique opportunity to overcome these empirical challenges and measure the health impacts of car pollution. Using the universe of vehicle registrations, we demonstrate that a 10 percent cheating-induced increase in car exhaust increases rates of low birth weight and acute asthma attacks among children by 1.9 and 8.0 percent, respectively. These health impacts occur at all pollution levels and across the entire socioeconomic spectrum.},

We develop a theoretical model to divide trade's impact on pollution into scale, technique, and composition effects and then examine this theory using data on sulfur dioxide concentrations. We find international trade creates relatively small changes in pollution concentrations when it alters the composition of national output. Estimates of the trade-induced technique and scale effects imply a net reduction in pollution from these sources. Combining our estimates of all three effects yields a somewhat surprising conclusion: freer trade appears to be good for the environment.},

In doing so, we employ a carbon emission function to investigate the environmental Kuznets curve phenomenon, which describes a relationship between economic growth and environmental degradation. The empirical results confirm the existence of an N-shaped relationship between economic growth and CO2 emissions in the EU-5 countries. We incorporate additional variables such as renewable electricity consumption, trade openness, natural resource abundance, and energy innovation to augment the carbon emission function. Renewable electricity consumption, natural resources, and energy innovation improve environmental quality, while trade openness and the interaction between economic growth and renewable electricity consumption exert a positive impact on CO2 emissions. This study is novel in that it presents an interaction between economic growth and renewable electricity consumption. We also confirm the need for renewable energy regulations related to increasing renewable sources and promoting energy innovation to reduce the negative effects of energy and fossil energy resources on environmental degradation.},

Overall, we estimate that WTP for allowing fracing equals about \$1,300 to \$1,900 per household annually (2.5\% to 3.7\%), although there is substantial heterogeneity across shale regions.},

The survey focuses on country (ies) coverage, periods, modeling methodologies, and empirical conclusions. Our survey is based on the direction of causality between (i)energy consumption (electricity, nuclear, renewable and non-renewable) and economic growth; (ii) between economic growth and environment; and between the three variables at the same time. As a general remark from these studies is that the literature produced paradoxical and not conclusive results which energy consumption can boost economic growth through the productivity enhancement and it can boost also the environmental damages through the enhancement of pollutant emissions. This survey gives researchers a ‘snap shot’ of the literature on the causality between the four types of energy, environment and economic growth for both individual and collective cases. Understanding the causal links between environment, economic growth and different types of energy consumption provides a basis for discussion in order to design and implementating effective energy and environmental policies.},

The paper exploits the macro economic approach of the endogenous growth models with technological change for a comparative assessment of these policy measures on the economic growth in the US and Japan in the medium and the long run. The results of our micro estimates reveal several important differences across the Japanese and US energy firms: lower elasticity of innovation production function in R\&D expenditure, lower probability of a radical innovation, and larger advances of dirty technologies in Japan. This may explain our quantitative findings of stronger reliance on carbon tax than on research subsidies in Japan relative to the US.},

Crack cocaine users evidenced greater levels of impulsivity and risk-taking propensity, with only the difference in impulsivity persisting after controlling for age and gender.

We show that a family of causal effect parameters are identified in staggered DiD setups, even if differences in observed characteristics create non-parallel outcome dynamics between groups. Our identification results allow one to use outcome regression, inverse probability weighting, or doubly-robust estimands. We also propose different aggregation schemes that can be used to highlight treatment effect heterogeneity across different dimensions as well as to summarize the overall effect of participating in the treatment. We establish the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators and prove the validity of a computationally convenient bootstrap procedure to conduct asymptotically valid simultaneous (instead of pointwise) inference. Finally, we illustrate the relevance of our proposed tools by analyzing the effect of the minimum wage on teen employment from 2001--2007. Open-source software is available for implementing the proposed methods.},

We estimate that these delays can translate into substantial transfers and provide examples in which they can substantially reduce deviation frequency. (JEL K21, L12, L71, L81)},

Using monthly data for the different provinces of Argentina during 1998–2000, we make an evaluation of that effect. After performing a series of nested and non-nested hypothesis tests, we conclude that we cannot reject the hypothesis that the market was a Cournot oligopoly before the merger, and after that it became one with a price leader (Repsol-YPF). This implies an efficiency loss estimated in more than \$36 million per month.},

  abstract = {In Brazil, the consensus that natural gas regulation has failed to attract investments, especially from private companies, culminated in a new law for the natural gas sector, passed in March 2009 (Law No. 11,909). The most significant change this new law introduced was the new governmental role in co-ordinating investments in the transportation sector. The Brazilian government has had to plan pipeline networks, estimate the size of demand for transportation and organise bidding to select investors for new pipeline projects. Although the law has established a clear regulatory framework for the midstream sector, providing stability and the legal certainty necessary for long-term investments in assets with high specificity, it has not been able to fill all of the gaps that remain under Law 9,478. In this sense, besides the challenges related to effective implementation of the regulatory attributes defined in Law 11,909, the absence of certain issues prevents the modified legal structure from encouraging the entry of new players in the transportation sector. This paper has identified, according to the neo-institutional view, the mechanisms of co-ordination introduced by the new law and the limitations of the new regulatory framework.},

The critical distinction between formats is that an ascending auction provides the bidders with information through the process of bidding. This information is a two-edged sword. It may stimulate competition by creating a reliable process of price discovery, by reducing the winner’s curse, and by allowing efficient aggregations of items. Alternatively, the information may be used by bidders to establish and enforce collusive outcomes. Ex ante asymmetries and weak competition favor a sealed-bid design. In other cases, an ascending auction is likely to perform better in efficiency and revenue terms. Moreover, information in an ascending auction can be tailored to limit collusion. 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {A firm energy market for Colombia is presented. Firm energy—the ability to provide energy in a dry period—is the product needed for reliability in Colombia’s hydrodominated electricity market. The firm energy market coordinates investment in new resources to assure that sufficient firm energy is available in dry periods. Load procures in an annual auction enough firm energy to cover its needs. The firm energy product includes both a financial call option and the physical capability to supply firm energy. The call option protects load from high spot prices and improves the performance of the spot market during scarcity. The market provides strong performance incentives through the spot energy price. Market power is addressed directly: existing resources cannot impact the firm energy price. Since load is hedged from high spot prices, the market can rely on high prices to balance supply and demand during dry periods, rather than rationing.},

Subjects decide how many boxes to collect out of 100, one of which contains a bomb. Earnings increase linearly with the number of boxes accumulated but are zero if the bomb is also collected. The BRET requires minimal numeracy skills, avoids truncation of the data, allows the precise estimation of both risk aversion and risk seeking, and is not affected by the degree of loss aversion or by violations of the Reduction Axiom. We validate the BRET, test its robustness in a large-scale experiment, and compare it to three popular risk elicitation tasks. Choices react significantly only to increased stakes, and are sensible to wealth effects. Our experiment rationalizes the gender gap that often characterizes choices under uncertainty by means of a higher loss rather than risk aversion.},

The results obtained showed significant differences between condensable compounds generated in presence and absence of catalysts. The liquid fraction obtained without catalyst was composed principally by linear paraffins (C10–C40) and almost no generation of aromatic compounds was observed. The presence of low amounts of zeolite (HZSM-5 or HUSY) led to a significant reduction of the saturated and unsaturated condensable hydrocarbons, while it favored the formation of aromatics and branched paraffins. Compared with the results reached with HZSM-5 zeolite, HUSY produces higher amount of aromatics and branched alkanes and a narrower distribution of products, independently of the pyrolysis temperature. The reactor employed in this work was a fluidized bed reactor, very similar to that used in generation of gasoline-range hydrocarbons at large scale, which allows to illustrate a very useful method for the recovery of these hydrocarbons.},

However, if a shipper does not use some of its contracted firm transportation capacity, the pipeline can resell that capacity as interruptible transportation. That is, the pipeline has residual rights with respect to firm transportation capacity contracted for by shippers. We demonstrate that these residual rights can have a significant effect on the competitiveness of the secondary market for natural gas transportation. A consequence of these residual rights is that the secondary market for natural gas transportation may be considerably more competitive than indicated by measures of concentration like the widely used Herfindahl–Hirschman Index.},

However, market structure has been identified as playing a role in price dynamics, equilibrium selection and price differentials across markets and stations. The economic literature emphasizes the importance of heterogeneity across stations and coordination problems faced by retailers. Several directions for future work are suggested, including the development of theory and demand estimation using high-frequency station level data.},

Both isothermal and dynamic experiments at different heating rates have been performed in a thermobalance with the objective of determining the kinetic parameters. Also, a first set of experiments, performed in a cylindrical stainless-steel atmospheric pressure reactor, was designed to evaluate the products of the pyrolysis process. The effects of N2 flow rate (200–300~cm3 min− 1), initial mass fed to the reactor (15–75~mg), temperature (415–490~°C), and heating rate (5–30~K min− 1) were studied. By application of a first order kinetic model, the activation energy for every plastic has been determined. The values of activation energy in isothermic and dynamic regimen are the following: natural polystyrene: 136, and 168 to 286~kJ/mol. Recycled plastic: 250, and 150 to 290~kJ/mol.

Recent experimental evidence supports the theory, as students' behavior has been found to be consistent with myopic loss aversion (MLA). Yet, much like certain anomalies in the realm of riskless decision?making, these behavioral tendencies may be attenuated among professionals. Using traders recruited from the CBOT, we do indeed find behavioral differences between professionals and students, but rather than discovering that the anomaly is muted, we find that traders exhibit behavior consistent with MLA to a greater extent than students.},

The model is estimated using price data from retail outlets from the South-Eastern Queensland region in Australia, but the generic nature of the model means that the results will be of general interest. The results indicate that when the cost of crude oil and demographic variations across different localities are accounted for, branding (i.e. whether the retail outlet is affiliated with one of the major brand distributers - Shell, Caltex, Mobil or BP) has a statistically significant positive effect on prices at nearby retail outlets. Conversely, the presence of an independent (non-branded) retailer within a locality has the effect of lowering retail prices. Furthermore, the results of this research show that service stations participating in discount coupon schemes with the two major retail supermarket chains have the effect of largely off-setting the price increase derived from branding affiliation. While, branding effects are not fully cancelled out, the overall effect is that prices are still higher than if branding did not occur.},

The study concludes that in laboratory markets that have many of the essential economic features of the barge industry, rate filing policies cause higher prices, lower volume, and reduced efficiency, and they hurt the small participants. Claims that rate filing policies would improve the operations of markets with these economic features are not supported by the laboratory research conducted to date.},

  abstract = {Plastics are inexpensive, lightweight and durable materials, which can readily be moulded into a variety of products that find use in a wide range of applications. As a consequence, the production of plastics has increased markedly over the last 60 years. However, current levels of their usage and disposal generate several environmental problems. Around 4 per cent of world oil and gas production, a non-renewable resource, is used as feedstock for plastics and a further 3–4\% is expended to provide energy for their manufacture. A major portion of plastic produced each year is used to make disposable items of packaging or other short-lived products that are discarded within a year of manufacture. These two observations alone indicate that our current use of plastics is not sustainable. In addition, because of the durability of the polymers involved, substantial quantities of discarded end-of-life plastics are accumulating as debris in landfills and in natural habitats worldwide. Recycling is one of the most important actions currently available to reduce these impacts and represents one of the most dynamic areas in the plastics industry today. Recycling provides opportunities to reduce oil usage, carbon dioxide emissions and the quantities of waste requiring disposal. Here, we briefly set recycling into context against other waste-reduction strategies, namely reduction in material use through downgauging or product reuse, the use of alternative biodegradable materials and energy recovery as fuel. While plastics have been recycled since the 1970s, the quantities that are recycled vary geographically, according to plastic type and application. Recycling of packaging materials has seen rapid expansion over the last decades in a number of countries. Advances in technologies and systems for the collection, sorting and reprocessing of recyclable plastics are creating new opportunities for recycling, and with the combined actions of the public, industry and governments it may be possible to divert the majority of plastic waste from landfills to recycling over the next decades.},

  abstract = {We use a data set consisting of a three year panel of prices from a sample of gasoline stations located in suburban Washington DC and a corresponding census of the region's stations to develop three new empirical findings about retail gasoline pricing. First, while average retail margins vary substantially over time (by more than 50\% over the three years we analyze), the shape of the margin distribution remains relatively constant. Second, there is substantial heterogeneity in pricing behavior: stations charging very low or very high prices are more likely to maintain their pricing position than stations charging prices near the mean. Third, retail gasoline pricing is dynamic. Despite the heterogeneity in station pricing behavior, stations frequently change their relative pricing position in this distribution, sometimes dramatically. We then relate these three findings to relevant theories of retail pricing. While many models of retail pricing are consistent with some of our findings, we find that all have serious shortcomings.},

  abstract = {Energy consumption is one of the important inputs to the production process. Energy consumption and energy supplied from fossil fuels in production process cause CO2 emissions and environmental deterioration. Due to this fact achieving economic development and environmental sustainability simultaneously is one of the most significant development challenges for Africa today. Formulation of sound economic development and environmental sustainability policy needs knowing the relationship among energy use, economic growth and environmental quality. This study examines the relationship among economic growth, energy consumption, financial development, trade openness, urbanization, population and CO2 emissions over the period of 1970–2014 in case of Ethiopia. The PP, ADF, KPSS, Zivot-Andrews and Clemente, Montanes and Reyes unit root tests were used to test the stationarity of the variables under consideration. The ARDL cointegration technique for establishing the existence of a long-run relationship and Toda-Yamamoto approach to determine the direction of causality between the variables were used. The results show that cointegration exists among the variables. Energy consumption, population, trade openness and economic growth have statistically significant positive impact on CO2 in the long-run while economic growth squared compacts CO2 emissions. This supports validity of the EKC hypothesis in Ethiopia. In the short-run urbanization and energy consumption intensify environmental degradation. Toda-Yamamoto granger causality results indicate the feedback relationship between energy consumption, CO2 emissions and urbanization. Financial development, population and urbanization cause economic growth while economic growth causes CO2 emissions. Causality runs from energy consumption to financial development, urbanization and population which in turn cause economic growth. Form the result, CO2 emissions extenuation policy in Ethiopia should focus on environmentally friendly growth, enhancing consumption of clean energy, incorporating the impact of population growth, urbanization, trade and financial development.},

  abstract = {We examine how product and pricing decisions of retail gasoline stations depend on local market demographics and the degree of competitive intensity in the market. We are able to shed light on the observed empirical phenomenon that proximate gasoline stations price very similarly in some markets, but very differently in other markets. Our analysis of product design and price competition between firms integrates two critical dimensions of heterogeneity across consumers: Consumers differ in their locations and in their travel costs, as in models of horizontal differentiation. They also differ in their relative preference or valuations for product quality dimensions, in terms of the offered station services (such as pay-at-pump, number of service bays or other added services), as in models of vertical differentiation. We find that the degree of local competitive intensity and the dispersion in consumer incomes are sufficient to explain variations in the product and pricing choices of competing firms. Closely located retailers who face sufficient income dispersion across consumers in a local market may differentiate on product design and pricing strategies. In contrast, retailers that are farther apart from each other may adopt similar product design and pricing strategies if the market is relatively homogeneous on income. Using empirical survey data on prices and station characteristics gathered across 724 gasoline stations in the St. Louis metropolitan area, and employing a multivariate logit model that predicts the joint probability of stations within a local market differentiating on product design and pricing strategies as a function of market demographics and local competitive intensity, we find strong support for the central implications of the theory.},

Poland generates yearly between 10 and 11.5 Mt (million tonnes) of post-consumer waste although exact data are not consistent. The Polish Statistical Office GUS published that in 2014 post-consumer waste generation was at the level of 10.3 Mt which corresponds to about 270 kg per capita per year – one of the lowest figures in Europe. In terms of waste treatment methods, 21 percent of this waste was recycled in mechanical recycling, 11 percent was recovered by composting, 15 percent was used in energy recovery processes. The remaining 53 percent (5.4 Mt) was landfilled which is a great reduction as compared to 2010 (landfilling at the level of 73 percent), however it needs to be mentioned that many experts challenge these figures claiming that waste generation and landfilling in reality are significantly (1 to 2 Mt) higher.},

In this study, we present results from a unique new dataset, including daily sales, cost, and price data from 100 retail gasoline stations in a western European country. With this data, we empirically test various economic models to confirm, in full or in part, some earlier results based on North American data. We discuss a special case in which we empirically fit a model where retailers set prices partly in response to local competitors’ prices.},

  abstract = {A basic tenet of economics posits that when consumers or firms don't face the true social cost of their actions, market outcomes are inefficient. In the case of negative externalities, Pigouvian taxes are one way to correct this market failure, where the optimal tax leads agents to internalize the true cost of their actions. A practical complication, however, is that the level of externality nearly always varies across economic agents and directly taxing the externality may be infeasible. In such cases, policy often taxes a product correlated with the externality. For example, instead of taxing vehicle emissions directly, policy makers may tax gasoline even though per-gallon emissions vary across vehicles. This paper estimates the implications of this approach within the personal transportation market. We have three general empirical results. First, we show that vehicle emissions are positively correlated with vehicle elasticities for miles traveled with respect to fuel prices (in absolute value)—i.e. dirtier vehicles respond more to fuel prices. This correlation substantially increases the optimal second-best uniform gasoline tax. Second, and perhaps more importantly, we show that a uniform tax performs very poorly in eliminating deadweight loss associated with vehicle emissions; in many years in our sample over 75 percent of the deadweight loss remains under the optimal second-best gasoline tax. Substantial improvements to market efficiency require differentiating based on vehicle type, for example vintage. Finally, there is a more positive result: because of the positive correlation between emissions and elasticities, the health benefits from a given gasoline tax increase by roughly 90 percent, compared to what one would expect if emissions and elasticities were uncorrelated.},

Explicitly accounting for soft skills often implies departing from the standard economic model by integrating concepts studied in behavioral and experimental economics, such as self-control, willingness to compete, intrinsic motivation, and self-confidence. We review how approaches from behavioral economics help our understanding of the complexity of educational investments and outcomes, and we discuss what insights can be gained from such concepts in the context of education.},

  abstract = {In this paper we develop the first agent-based integrated assessment model, which offers an alternative to standard, computable general-equilibrium frameworks. The Dystopian Schumpeter meeting Keynes (DSK) model is composed of heterogeneous firms belonging to capital-good, consumption-good and energy sectors. Production and energy generation lead to greenhouse gas emissions, which affect temperature dynamics in a non-linear way. Increasing temperature triggers climate damages hitting, at the micro-level, workers’ labor productivity, energy efficiency, capital stock and inventories of firms. In that, aggregate damages are emerging properties of the out-of-equilibrium interactions among heterogeneous and boundedly rational agents. We find the DSK model is able to account for a wide ensemble of micro and macro empirical regularities concerning both economic and climate dynamics. Moreover, different types of shocks have heterogeneous impact on output growth, unemployment rate, and the likelihood of economic crises. Finally, we show that the magnitude and the uncertainty associated to climate change impacts increase over time, and that climate damages much larger than those estimated through standard IAMs. Our results point to the presence of tipping points and irreversible trajectories, thereby suggesting the need of urgent policy interventions.},

  abstract = {A detailed, mechanistic model for high-density polyethylene pyrolysis was created based on the modeling framework developed in our previous work and was used to study the time evolution of low molecular weight products formed. Specifically, the role that unzipping, backbiting, and random scission reaction pathways play in the evolution of low molecular weight species was probed. The model tracked 151 species and included over 11,000 reactions. Rate parameters were adapted from our previous work, literature values, and regression against experimental data. The model results were found to be in excellent agreement with experimental data for the evolution of condensable low molecular weight products. The time evolution curves of specific low molecular weight products indicated that the random scission pathway was important for all species, while the backbiting pathway played a complementary role. Net rate analysis was used to further elucidate the competition between the pathways. Net rate analysis of end-chain radicals showed that the unzipping pathway was not competitive with the other pathways, as expected based on experimental yields of ethylene. The random scission pathway was found to be controlling, with the backbiting pathway playing a more minor role for product formation. By comparing the net rates for formation of specific mid-chain radicals via intramolecular hydrogen shift reactions, the contribution of the backbiting pathway was shown to vary, with radicals formed via the most facile x,x + 4-intramolecular hydrogen transfer reactions being favored.},

In this paper, we examine directly how gasoline taxes affect gasoline consumption as distinct from tax-inclusive retail gasoline prices. We find robust evidence that consumers respond more strongly to gasoline tax changes under a variety of model specifications. We discuss two potential reasons for our main findings as well as their implications. (JEL D12, H21, H25, H31, L71, Q35)},

The bed temperature was set at 800°C and each sample was separated into three different size fractions (0–5 mm, 5–10 mm and 10–20 mm). The results show for all the samples particle size has an effect on pyrolysis product yields and composition: smaller particle size results in higher gas yield with less tar and char; the decrease of particle size can increase H2 and CO contents of gas, as well as the ash and carbon element contents in the char. And the influence is the much more significant for sample with higher fixed carbon and ash contents, such as kitchen garbage, and less for sample with higher volatile content, plastic in the test.},

  abstract = {Summary The provision of electricity has been a great benefit to society, particularly in health terms, but it also carries health costs. Comparison of different forms of commercial power generation by use of the fuel cycle methods developed in European studies shows the health burdens to be greatest for power stations that most pollute outdoor air (those based on lignite, coal, and oil). The health burdens are appreciably smaller for generation from natural gas, and lower still for nuclear power. This same ranking also applies in terms of greenhouse-gas emissions and thus, potentially, to long-term health, social, and economic effects arising from climate change. Nuclear power remains controversial, however, because of public concern about storage of nuclear waste, the potential for catastrophic accident or terrorist attack, and the diversion of fissionable material for weapons production. Health risks are smaller for nuclear fusion, but commercial exploitation will not be achieved in time to help the crucial near-term reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions. The negative effects on health of electricity generation from renewable sources have not been assessed as fully as those from conventional sources, but for solar, wind, and wave power, such effects seem to be small; those of biofuels depend on the type of fuel and the mode of combustion. Carbon dioxide (CO2) capture and storage is increasingly being considered for reduction of CO2 emissions from fossil fuel plants, but the health effects associated with this technology are largely unquantified and probably mixed: efficiency losses mean greater consumption of the primary fuel and accompanying increases in some waste products. This paper reviews the state of knowledge regarding the health effects of different methods of generating electricity.},

This is a relatively understudied element of the fuel switching literature in both developed and emerging economies. This research adds to this literature by examing the adoption time-path of network gas as a heating fuel. We merge a unique dataset on gas network roll-out over time, with other geo-coded data and employ an instrumental variables technique in order to simultaneously model supply and demand. Results indicate a non-linear relationship between the proportion of households using gas as their primary means of central heating and the length of time the network has been in place in each area. Proximity to the gas network, peat bogs, and areas which have banned the consumption of bituminous coal also affect gas connections. Variations in socioeconomic and dwelling characteristics at area level can also help explain connections to the gas network. Simulations are then performed to examine how network expansion might affect connections and carbon emissions.},

A small pilot scale pyrolysis reactor was commissioned for this purpose, and operated at optimum temperature and retention time of 450~°C and 75~min respectively. PS plastic waste showed maximum production of liquid oil (80.8\%) along with least production of gases (13\%) and char (6.2\%) in comparison to other plastic types. Liquid oils from all plastic types contained mostly aromatic compounds with some alkanes and alkenes. Liquid oil from PS pyrolysis contained styrene (48.3\%), ethylbenzene (21.2\%) and toluene (25.6\%). Pyrolysis liquid oils found to have ranges of dynamic viscosity (1.77–1.90~mPa~s), kinematic viscosity (1.92–2.09~cSt), density (0.91–0.92~g/cm3), pour point (−11(-60~°C)), freezing point (−15-(-65~°C)), flash point (28.1–30.2~°C) and high heating value (HHV) (41.4–41.8~MJ/kg) similar to conventional diesel, thus have potential as an alternative energy source for electricity generation. Upgrading of liquid oil using different post-treatment methods such as distillation, refining and blending with conventional diesel is required to make it suitable as a transport fuel due to presence of high aromatic compounds. The recovery of aromatic compounds especially styrene from pyrolysis oil can be a potential source of precursor chemical in industries for polymerization of styrene monomers.},

  abstract = {Vacuum pyrolysis of individual plastics including high density polyethylene (HDPE), low density polyethylene (LDPE), polypropylene (PP) and polystyrene (PS) has been performed at a final temperature of 500°C and under a total pressure of 2 kPa. A PVC sample and a commingled plastic sample composed of HDPE/LDPE/PP/PS/PVC have been pyrolyzed in two consecutive steps at 360 and 520°C in order to separately trap HCl. A pyrolysis set-up consisting of a bench scale batch reactor with a condensation train was used to collect the pyrolysis products. The main gaseous and liquid products, including the chlorinated hydrocarbons, were identified by chromatography. Global and chlorine mass balances were performed. The yields and pyrolysis product composition from each single polymer were compared with those from the commingled plastics. At 520°C, 99.55 wt.\% of the total chlorine was trapped as HCl corresponding to 4.6 wt.\% in yield, on an original feedstock basis, followed by 62.0 wt.\% wax, 31.1 wt.\% oil, 1.0 wt.\% gas and 1.2 wt.\% solid char residue (loss was 0.1 wt.\%). The pyrolysis oil contained 12 ppm Cl on a pyrolysis oil basis. This value was less than what was expected (153 ppm) from the theoretical values which were calculated when the individual polymers were pyrolysed. The chlorinated hydrocarbons formed during the pyrolysis of commingled plastics were different from those obtained during the thermal decomposition of pure PVC. However, the hydrocarbons produced in the oil fraction were similar to those identified during the pyrolysis of the single plastics.},

  abstract = {The pyrolysis of waste plastics (so called chemical recycling) is one perspective way of their utilizations, but the end product properties are a key point of the industrial leading of processes. In this paper a pilot scale pyrolysis process has been investigated. Waste plastics were decomposed in a tube reactor at 520~°C, using hourly feed rate of 9.0~kg. Raw materials were selectively collected wastes from agricultural and packaging industry. For supporting the more intensive cracking of CC bonds of main polymer structure a commercial ZSM-5 catalyst was tested in concentration of 5.0\%. Products were separated into gases, gasoline, light and heavy oil by distillation. Plastic wastes could be converted into gasoline and light oil with yields of 20–48\% and 17–36\% depending on the used parameters. The gas and liquid products had significant content of unsaturated hydrocarbons, principally olefins. In the presence of ZSM-5 catalyst the yields of lighter fractions (especially gasoline) could be considerably increased and the average molecular weight of each fraction has decreased. Gasoline had C5–C15 hydrocarbons, while light oil had C12–C28. The used catalyst has promoted the formation of i-butane in gases and affected the composition of both gasoline and light oil. Properties of products are advantageous for fuel-like applications, and they are able to increase the productivity of refinery. On the other hand the possibility for further utilization of products from pyrolysis basically was affected by the source and the properties of raw materials. Waste polyethylene from agricultural consisted of some elements from fertilizers (N, S, P and Ca), which could not be removed from the surfaces of raw materials by pre-treatment (e.g. washing). In that case significant concentration of N, S, P and Ca can be measured in all products, but the catalyst has decreased the concentration of impurities. Gasoline, light oil and heavy oil were nitrogen free and sulphur content was below 12~mg/kg in hydrocarbons obtained by the pyrolysis of polypropylene waste from packaging.},

  abstract = {Recent changes in the mining industry have opened new opportunities for technological upgrading by local suppliers in developing countries. This paper explores the factors that foster or hinder innovation in such a context. We employ a case study methodology to analyze a sample of Peruvian mining contractors that integrated into knowledge-intensive stages of the value chain in recent years. Our main findings reveal that technological efforts are largely driven by the mining companies’ demands, which favor incumbent over emergent suppliers due to their experience in the local market. In order to integrate into the more knowledgeintensive stages of the value chain, we identified that these firms followed two strategies: (i) identification of local-specific market niches where foreign competition is scarce, and (ii) partnerships with global suppliers and specialization in high-quality and customized complementary services. Still, all the suppliers in the sample are very new in technologically complex activities, and their innovations remain limited from a global perspective. Our findings suggest that this is partly due to a weak institutional setting, scarce support from external organizations, and limited coordination channels in the sector.},

Using the Fudenberg—Tirole (American Economic Review 74 (1984), 361—368) taxonomy of business strategies, we provide a general discussion of merger decisions made in sequence by disjoint groups of firms. In a linear Cournot model, we retrieve all four business strategies of the general taxonomy by allowing for cost savings due to merger. We find that the prospects of a subsequent merger decision have an ambiguous effect on the profitability of the first merger. We also show, in our general framework, that, when merger decisions are interdependent over time, the condition of Farrell and Shapiro (American Economic Review 80 (1990), 107—126) overestimates a merger’s actual external effect. 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

I find three distinct pricing patterns: cost-based pricing, sticky pricing, and sharp asymmetric retail price cycles that resemble the Edgeworth cycles of Maskin and Tirole (1988). I use a Markov-switching regression to estimate the prevalence of the regimes and the structural characteristics of the cycles themselves. I find cycles are more prevalent when there are more small firms and are accelerated and amplified with very many small firms. In markets with few small firms, sticky pricing dominates. The findings are consistent with the theory of Edgeworth cycles.},

  abstract = {This article deals with the waste management of post-consumer plastics in Germany and its potential to save fossil fuels and reduce CO2 emissions. Since most of the experience available is for packaging the paper first gives an outline of the legislative background and the material flows for this sector. The recycling and recovery processes for plastics waste from all sectors are then assessed in terms of their potential contribution to energy saving and CO2 abatement. Practically all the options studied show better performance regarding these two aspects than waste treatment in an average incinerator (which has been chosen as the reference case). High ecological benefits can be achieved by mechanical recycling if virgin polymers are substituted. The cost effectiveness of reducing energy use and CO2 emissions is determined for a number of technologies. There is large scope to reduce the costs, with an estimated overall saving potential of 50\% within one to two decades. The paper then presents scenario projections which are based on the assumption that the total plastics waste in Germany in 1995 is treated in processes which will be available by 2005; considerable savings can be made by moving away from the business-as-usual path to highly efficient waste incinerators (advanced waste-to-energy facilities). Under these conditions the distribution of plastics waste among mechanical recycling and feedstock recycling has a comparatively small impact on the overall results. The maximum savings amount to 74 PJ of energy, i.e. 9\% of the chemical sector's energy demand in 1995 and 7.0 Mt CO2, representing 13\% of the sector's emissions and 0.8\% of Germany's total CO2 emissions. This shows that plastics waste management offers some scope for reducing environmental burdens. The assessment does not support a general recommendation of energy recovery, mainly due to the large difference between the German average and the best available waste-to-energy facilities.11 Mt=1 metric megatonne=109 kg=2.205*109 lb; 1 PJ=1 petajoule=277.8 GWh. 1},

  abstract = {This paper proposes robust inference methods for difference-in-differences and event-study designs that do not require that the parallel trends assumption holds exactly. Instead, the researcher must only impose restrictions on possible violations of the parallel trends assumption, and our methodology then guarantees uniformly valid (“honest”) inference when the imposed restrictions are satisfied. We first show that fixed length confidence intervals have near-optimal expected length for a practically-relevant class of restrictions. We next introduce a novel inference procedure that accommodates a wider range of restrictions on the possible violations of parallel trends, and is based on the observation that inference in our setting is equivalent to testing a system of moment inequalities with a large number of linear nuisance parameters. The resulting confidence sets are consistent, and have optimal local asymptotic power for many parameter configurations. We recommend researchers conduct sensitivity analyses to show what conclusions can be drawn under various restrictions on the set of possible violations of parallel trends.},

Este trabajo investiga la naturaleza de la competencia y define la extensión geográfica del mercado relevante en la venta al por menor de combustibles líquidos en la ciudad de Bogotá D.C. Mediante el uso de un modelo espacial auto regresivo (SAR) se encuentra que el mercado relevante corresponde a las estaciones de gasolina ubicadas dentro de un radio de 1 kilómetro de distancia de la estación en análisis, y que la intensidad de la competencia disminuye con la distancia. Además, se encuentra que la bandera a la cual pertenecen las estaciones de gasolina rivales tiene un efecto significativo sobre el precio cobrado por la estación en análisis, probando así que las estaciones de gasolina cobran diferentes precios al consumidor, dependiendo de a que rival se están enfrentando dentro del mercado relevante ya establecido. Este trabajo proporciona una herramienta de vital importancia para la entidad de regulación de competencia en Colombia, para que esta tome decisiones adecuadas, basadas en estudios empíricos, con respecto a las fusiones e integraciones dentro del mercado de venta de combustible líquido en el territorio nacional.English Abstract: The accurate definition of the relevant market is an important element in the analysis of anticompetitive practices and abuse of market power that can distort the economic efficiency. This paper examines the nature of the competition and defines the geographic extension of the relevant market in the retail gasoline market in the city of Bogotá D.C. Using a spatial auto regressive model (SAR), it is found that the relevant market includes all gas stations located within a one kilometer radius of distance from the gas station of analysis, and that the intensity of competition decreases with distance. Besides, it is found that the flag of the rival gas stations has a significant effect over the price charged by the gas station of analysis, proving that the gas stations charge different prices to the consumer, depending to which rival it is facing inside the already stablished relevant market. This paper provides a contribution for the competition and regulation entity in Colombia, so this entity can decide properly in terms of mergers and integrations inside the market of liquid fuel in the country.},

We can challenge this problem with the ‘smart market’: a coordination center applies optimization algorithms to private bids and offers submitted by decentralized agents to compute prices and allocations. This paper presents the laboratory development of a market institution for trading natural gas in a pipeline network. The institution has evolved over the past five years through thousands of hours of cash-motivated subject participation, professional analysis and continuous repro- gramming. It is not a trivial matter to engineer the most efficient market possible when subtle nuances in institutional rules can affect outcomes. Yet doing so in the laboratory is much less costly than a potentially failed field experiment.},

Different conditions like temperature, time and catalyst ratio were optimized for the maximum conversion of HDPE into liquid fraction. Catalytic degradation yielded 92\% liquid fraction whereas 90\% wax was obtained with thermal degradation. The composition of the liquid fraction was characterized by physicochemical properties of petroleum fuel tests. The catalytic liquid fraction consisted of high concentration of C8–C9, C13–C14 and C17–C18 hydrocarbons. The distillation data showed that ∼50\% of the fraction has boiling point in the range of gasoline and ∼50\% in the range of diesel oil.},

  abstract = {In this paper we develop an auction mechanism that is designed for a local energy market. It aims to enable regionally or virtually restricted trading of ancillary services, which enhances the position of the balance group responsible party beyond that of simple accounting. Furthermore, it makes local market participants somewhat more independent from the transmission grid operator, but at the same time provides incentives for investments in distributed generation technologies. A wider spread of these technologies can help to save CO2 emissions, while at the same time a part of them can also be used to counter the fluctuations of energy from volatile renewable sources, such as wind and solar power. Because of their relatively high margins and small share in total production, ancillary services are well-suited for a remuneration scheme. Participants in the auction are, thus, private households, which impose specific design characteristics on the auction. Most importantly, it needs to be transparent and easy to understand, as homeowners will typically not have the insights of a professional trader as well as lack a similar position and motivation. Also, the confinement to a single balance group, i.e. a local market, means that especially in the beginning of the trading only a small number of bidders can be expected. Therefore, competition will initially be limited, so that the auction design needs to be adapted accordingly. In order to test the performance of the proposed auction market design under varying information policies, a simple agent-based simulation program has been developed. We find that the theoretical predictions hold and that competition quickly leads to price convergence.},

In this two-industry economy, a zero-profit equilibrium with symmetrically located firms may exhibit rather strange properties. First, demand curves are kinked, although firms make "Nash" conjectures. If equilibrium lies at the kink, the effects of parameter changes are perverse. In the short run, prices are rigid in the face of small cost changes. In the long run, increases in costs lower equilibrium prices. Increases in market size raise prices. The welfare properties are also perverse at a kinked equilibrium.},

But where the costs of environmental degradation are borne by others (by the poor or by other countries), there are few incentives to alter damaging behavior.},

  abstract = {The study of oligopolistic industries lies at the heart of the field of industrial organization. The belief of an individual about the behavior of large firms in concentrated markets colors the individual's views on a broad range of antitrust and regulatory policies. These beliefs derive in turn from theory and evidence of oligopolists' behavior. This chapter presents and evaluates the primary competing theories of oligopolistic behavior. The chapter clarifies the way oligopoly theory has, and has not, progressed in the 150 years since Cournot developed his theory. Although oligopoly fits conceptually between the extremes of monopoly and perfect competition, its study requires a rather different set of tools—that is, those of game theory. The hallmark of oligopoly is the presence of strategic interactions among rival firms, a subject well suited for game-theoretic analysis. The chapter presumes a working knowledge of such concepts as Nash equilibrium and subgame perfect equilibrium.},

In the present study, an attempt has been made to provide a comprehensive review of the characteristics, generation, collection and transportation, disposal and treatment technologies of MSW practiced in India. The study pertaining to MSWM for Indian cities has been carried out to evaluate the current status and identify the major problems. Various adopted treatment technologies for MSW are critically reviewed, along with their advantages and limitations. The study is concluded with a few fruitful suggestions, which may be beneficial to encourage the competent authorities/researchers to work towards further improvement of the present system.},

We examine the FTC’s enforcement rationale and test whether these mergers were associated with post-merger price increases in either gasoline or diesel at retail and wholesale levels. Our findings indicate that the transactions were largely competitively neutral. There was some indication that some unbranded rack prices may have increased after the mergers, but this result was not robust across controls or assumptions. In some other instances, prices in merger affected areas may have fallen relative to prices elsewhere after the transactions.},

At sample averages of variables, our simultaneous-equations estimates of the short-and long-run rebound effect are 4.5\% and 22.2\%. But rising real income caused it to diminish substantially over the period, aided by falling fuel prices. With variables at 1997-2001 levels, our estimates are only 2.2\% and 10.7\%, considerably smaller than values typically assumed for policy analysis. With income and starting fuel efficiency at 1997-2001 levels and fuel prices 58 percent higher, the estimates are still only 3.1\% and 15.3\%, respectively.},

For sulfur emissions, the scale and convergence effects are significant, there is a strong negative time effect, and non-English legal origin and higher population density are associated with more rapidly declining emissions.

  abstract = {There is a significant increase in the attention given to green maritime ship technologies due to the growing importance of sustainable operations. The driving force behind this development is the implementation of several new legislative actions taken by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and the European Union (EU). One of the main questions that arise is whether this new emission legislation stimulates the implementation of sustainable energy-efficient maritime technologies. In this paper, a framework is developed that allows linking the different emission legislation initiatives in different countries with the technical energy-efficient solutions that could be used to comply with the legislation. Based on this framework, the main research question can be answered. It turns out that the EEDI (Energy-Efficient Design Index) does not in the first place stimulate the introduction of new ship engine technologies nor the use of alternative fuels, but rather makes shipping companies order ships with a reduced design speed. SEEMP (Ship Energy Efficient Management Plan) on the contrary makes companies shift to bi-fuel engine systems, rather than fully to alternative energy systems. The findings are of relevance both to policy-makers and to shipping companies.},

Así, los principales hallazgos indican que, luego de 5 años del inicio de una inversión: (i) el salario real por hora de los trabajadores dependientes aumenta en 10,1\% respecto al grupo de control; (ii) las horas trabajadas mensualmente por los dependientes aumentan en 7,7 horas, y para los independientes, en 12,8 horas; (iii) el ingreso mensual de los dependientes aumenta en 22\%, y para los independientes, en 17\%; (iv) el alquiler aumenta en 18,5\%; y (v) la probabilidad de estar sano incrementa en 9,4\%. Para poner en perspectiva estos incrementos, el efecto sobre el ingreso mensual de los trabajadores dependientes equivale a un desplazamiento del percentil 50 al 60.  Por otro lado, se encuentra que las externalidades generadas por estas inversiones son más elevadas para los individuos que trabajan en un sector vinculado a la minería dado que su salario real aumenta en 30.2\%. Los demás individuos también se ven beneficiados, aunque en menor medida, por lo que, al cabo de 5 años, su salario real aumenta en 8,1\%. Finalmente, se encuentra evidencia de que la densidad de los caminos y la intensidad de la luz nocturna satelital aumentan en el área de tratamiento respecto del grupo de control para los años con información disponible. Los resultados anteriores sugieren que estos potenciales mecanismos podrían explicar en parte los spillovers generados por las inversiones mineras en exploración.},

  abstract = {Achieving security of gas supply implies diversifying gas sources, while having enough supply, transportation, and storage capacity to meet demand peaks and supply interruptions. Devising a strategy for securing gas supply is not straightforward because gas supply depends on complex interactions of production, demand and infrastructure, and it is exposed to economic, regulatory, political, environmental and technical risks. To address this complexity, we propose a simulation approach that replicates the structure of the gas supply chain, including transportation constraints and demand fluctuations. We build and calibrate a computer model for the Colombian gas sector, and run the model to assess the impact of expanding transportation capacity and increasing market flexibility on the security of supply. Our analysis focuses on the operation and planned and proposed expansions of the transportation infrastructure because adequate regulation and development of this infrastructure can contribute to increase the security of supply in the gas sector. We find that proposed import facilities, specifically LNG import terminals at Buenaventura, increase system’s security under the current market structure.},

The first series of polymer cracking experiments was carried out in a glass reactor of 0.5dm3 volume at atmospheric pressure and in a temperature range 350–420°C, the second one in autoclaves under hydrogen pressure (∼3–5MPa) in the temperature range 380–440°C. The influence of cracking parameters, i.e. reaction temperature, presence and amount of cracking catalysts and composition of the polymer feed on product yields and composition of gas and liquid fractions are discussed. It was stated that the proper selection of the process parameters makes it possible to control, in the limited range, the product composition distribution as well as yields and composition of gas, gasoline and diesel oil fractions. Basic physicochemical properties of gasoline and diesel fuels obtained in both type of processes were characterised and discussed.},

  abstract = {Summary The exploitation of fossil fuels is integral to modern living and has been a key element of the rapid technological, social, and cultural changes of the past 250 years. Although such changes have brought undeniable benefits, this exploitation has contributed to a burden of illness through pollution of local and regional environments, and is the dominant cause of climate change. This pattern of development is therefore unsustainable at a global level. At the same time, about 2·4 billion of the world's population, disadvantaged by lack of access to clean energy, are exposed to high levels of indoor air pollutants from the inefficient burning of biomass fuels. Even in high-income countries, many people live in fuel poverty, and throughout the world, increasingly sedentary lifestyles (to which fossil-fuel-dependent transport systems contribute) are leading to chronic disease and injuries. Energy security is also an issue of growing concern to many governments in both the developed and developing world, and a potential source of international tension and conflict. In this Series, we examine the opportunities to improve health, reduce climate effects, and promote development through realistic adjustments in the way energy and food are produced and consumed.},

  abstract = {Due to the depleting fossil fuel sources such as crude oil, natural gas, and coal, the present rate of economic growth is unsustainable. Therefore, many sources of renewable energy have been exploited, but the potentials of some other sources such as plastics waste are yet to be fully developed as full scale economic activity. Development and modernization have brought about a huge increase in the production of all kinds of plastic commodities, which directly or indirectly generate waste due to their wide range of applications coupled with their versatility of types and relatively low cost. The current scenario of the plastic recycling technology is reviewed in this paper. The aim is to provide the reader with an in-depth analysis with respect to the pyrolysis of plastic waste as obtained in the current recycling technology. As the calorific value of the plastics is comparable to that of hydrocarbon fuel, production of fuel from plastic waste would provide a good opportunity to utilize the waste as a better alternative to dumpsites. Different techniques of converting plastics waste into fuel including thermal and catalytic pyrolysis, microwave-assisted pyrolysis and fluid catalytic cracking are discussed in detail. The co-pyrolysis of plastics waste with biomass is also highlighted. Thus, an attempt was made to address the problem of plastic waste disposal as a partial replacement of the depleting fossil fuel with the hope of promoting a sustainable environment.},

Economically, the statistical precision challenges leading estimates of the cost-of-capital elasticity of investment, or undermines models in which dividend tax reforms affect the cost of capital.

Households often continue to use old technologies alongside new ones, and the energy-saving technologies have shorter actual lifetimes than their designed lifetimes. These two factors are considered when computing marginal energy conservation cost and marginal CO2 abatement cost using data collected from a survey of rural households in three provinces in China. The results show that there are cost reduction for most space heating technologies, and their marginal abatement cost under full implementation ranges from À60 to 15 USD/tCO2, while the marginal abatement cost of cooking technologies ranges from 12 to 85 USD/t-CO2. The marginal abatement costs of the majority of technologies increased after accounting for the two implementation factors. The marginal abatement cost in the imperfect implementation scenario is higher, with a range of À1 to 15 USD/t-CO2 for space heating, and 18 to 165 USD/t-CO2 for cooking. Assuming implementation factors are constant until 2035, annually achievable CO2 abatement by 2035 is estimated to be 57, 11, and 10 Mt-CO2/y in Hebei, Guizhou, and Guangxi Provinces.},
