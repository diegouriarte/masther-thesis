Sobre los datos
=======================================================
Four brands with only a handful of
stations were combined into one category, OTHER. Dummy variables for
the brand of gasoline are used to control for cost differences between the
different brands. Since stations under the same brand purchase gasoline
from their respective brand’s wholesaler, these dummy variables should
capture any variation in a station’s marginal cost of gasoline.

Justificacion del modelo
=========================================================
Whereas spatial econometrics is used extensively in the fields of
public and urban economics to test for the existence of strategic
interaction between economic agents in close proximity, there is less
research outside of these fields examining strategic interaction between
geographically close firms. In contrast to standard estimation techniques,
the methodology controls for the inherent endogeneity that is present
when strategic interaction exists. This paper utilizes spatial econometric
methods to test for the existence of strategic interaction between retail
gas stations in the Houston metropolitan area. Since the primary form of
product differentiation in the retail gasoline market is location, this
market is an ideal market to test for the presence of strategic interaction. 
Results indicate that gas stations engage in strategic interaction with
neighboring stations when setting prices and specification tests suggest
that the each station considers the behavior of its fifteen nearest
competitors. 

Significancia de marca
================================
As previously stated, the main result from this research is that branding leads to higher prices
at service stations. Speci<U+FB01>cally, it is found that branding is associated with a 0.8-1 cent increase
per litre in the average monthly price of retail gasoline. A similar result has been shown in
Hastings (2004), which describes the impact of a vertical merger, where a vertically integrated
chain merged with a chain of vertically separated retailers. In this paper it was shown that a take
over of an independent chain by a brand retailer led to higher retail prices in among service station
outlets in San Diego and Los Angeles. Hence, the price change that was reported, could have been
either a consequence of the change in the vertical structure of this market or a result of increased
concentration as a consequence of the merger. By contrast results in this study show a di<U+FB00>erence
in prices purely as a consequence of a<U+FB03>liation with a brand. This means that a consumers can
expect to pay a lower price if they were to purchase fuel from an independent or non-branded
retailer. (Hogg)

Comparación OLS con SAR
========================================================

It should be noted that the significance of %CHILD, INCOME and
%DRIVE in the OLS model is comparable to previous studies on gasoline
pricing. The fact that the estimated coefficients become smaller and less
significant is consistent with OLS yielding biased estimates in the
presence of unaccounted for spatial dependence. The biased OLS
estimates highlight the drawback of ignoring the endogenous nature of
the pricing decision in the retail gasoline market. 

The finding that gas stations take into account the behavior of nearby
stations when making their own pricing decision is crucial to
understanding the retail gasoline market. If a highly competitive retail
gasoline market prevented local stations from possessing pricing power
then variation in local demand would primarily drive variation in prices
and we would expect to find little strategic interaction between
neighboring stations. The existence of strong strategic interaction
suggests that competitive forces at the local level could partially explain
the wide dispersion of prices found in the sample. With the gasoline
industry having experienced significant consolidation in the late 1990s
and early 2000s, the regulatory spotlight has been on the impact of
mergers on wholesale gasoline markets. Any regulatory focus on
consolidation’s impact on retail markets has been limited to preventing
a brand from obtaining too large of a market share in a particular area. 
However, this study’s finding of strategic interaction suggests a more
complicated competitive environment that simple market share measures
do not capture. 

La importancia del lambda
========================================================

The importance of the large and strongly significant strategic
interaction coefficient, and hence the spatial multiplier, is illustrated by
examining the impact that the percent of commuters driving to work has
on a station’s price. The coefficient of %DRIVE is -0.00042 and
significant at the 10-percent level, indicating that a 10 percentage-point
increase in %DRIVE has a direct effect of a 0.4¢ decrease in the price of
gasoline. However, competition within the interconnected market results
in competitors responding to the 0.4¢ shift in the initial firm’s reaction
function with lower prices of their own which in turn feeds back into the
initial firm who responses with further price cuts until the new
equilibrium is achieved. Therefore the total effect of a 10 percentage-
point increase in %DRIVE on a firm’s price includes both the direct effect
measured by the coefficient of %DRIVE and the indirect effect from the
feedback of changing prices rippling through the interconnected market. 
The total effect is calculated by multiplying the direct effect of the
coefficient by the spatial multiplier. Consequently, the 10 percentage-
point increase in %DRIVE ultimately decreases a station’s price by 1.2¢,
approximately 2/3rds of which results from the geographic competition
inherent in the market. (Byrne)

Efectos fijos
========================================================
With the <U+FB01>xed-effects speci<U+FB01>cation, the effects on price of any station or local market
characteristics that are time invariant cannot be
determined independently from the <U+FB01>xed effect.
Hence citywide effects cannot be estimated, nor
can the effects on price of location, store size,
number of pumps, or service amenities, be de-
termined separately from the <U+FB01>xed effect. How-
ever, since there were large discrete changes in
a key variable—a competitor’s ownership and
contract type—during the observation period,
we can obtain consistent estimates of the price
effects for the variables most relevant to current
policy decisions. It is precisely the discrete na-
ture of the conversions of the independent retail
stations and their broad geographical distribu-
tion that allow for convincing identi<U+FB01>cation of
the price effects of independents. (Hastings)

Gasoline stations are differentiated along
many dimensions: brand, location, and ameni-
ties such as car washes, number of pumps, etc.
The Thrifty station conversions essentially
change the identity of a competitor along a
single dimension, holding all other characteris-
tics constant. This event allows us to examine
how pro<U+FB01>t-maximizing competitors react if we
were to take a product and change its location in
the “brand characteristics” space, all else equal.
We can use the reactions of competitors to this
change to better understand underlying model
of consumer preferences, demand, and compe—
tition in retail gasoline.
